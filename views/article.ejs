        CLINTON - As round 8 of the Alliance of Sunday Morning Chugs startup
        draft came to a close, the commissioner took a suggestion from the owner
        of the White Panthers franchise and asked for all league owners to
        submit a ranked list of individual drafts to this point. The Goathouse
        Alums came in as heavy favorites from the early rounds after grabbing
        Cook, Mahomes, and Kelce with his first 3 picks, despite drafting from
        the 7th spot in the draft. Bringing up the rear, Baba Yagas finished
        with the lowest amount of votes and lowest standard deviation. The
        highly disregarded Slayton Slayerz owner finished second to last with a
        tally of 29. While many consider the Slayerz draft to be full of
        reaches, there's no doubt the upside is there. Last of note, the 45ers
        scored a standard deviation of over 4, as he was voted either in the top
        3 or bottom 3 by each of the 11 teams. The power rankings will be
        updated after round 16.
